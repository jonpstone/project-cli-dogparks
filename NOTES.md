"NorthBark Dog Park is a 22.3 acre "off-leash" dog park, in far north Dallas. It is located near the North Dallas Tollway and the President George Bush Tollway. This dog park offers everything a pooch could want; including trails, swale and an expansive lawn area. Pamper your pet on the unique "dog beach" adjacent to the doggy lake, frolic on the 6 foot wide loop trail, lounge under the pavilion, or cool off in the doggy shower surrounded by beautiful metal fencing with custom cut dog silhouettes and elegant flagstone structures.

The pond is now open for your furry friends to enjoy!

Closed on rainy days and on Tuesdays for maintenance.

Fun Fact: This unique K-9 haven is the largest of its kind in North Texas. It features a doggy lake, showers and pavilion."
